# PowerReceiver
This app is a simple demo on how to use broadcast receivers. A toast message pops up when the power is connected and disconnected (system broadcasts) and when the button is pressed, a local broadcast receiver is triggered and a different toast message pops up. The receiver is registered dynamically, so the broadcast will only work if the app is running.
